# What is this?

Data viz about how people introduce themselves at the start of each week's [Chi Hack Night](https://chihacknight.org/).

# Is this useful?

Maybe!

Potential uses:

+ Could help show that not everyone who comes to Hack Night is a techie. As the Chi Hack Night website [says](https://chihacknight.org/about.html#everyone):

  > Not a techie? That's ok! We encourage non-technical folks to pair up and learn from our community's designers and developers. We've seen time and time again, he best civic projects come from teams with a diverse background.

  > Remember, there's much more to making a great app than just coding.

+ Could be useful for reflecting on Chi Hack Night membership and turnout.

# Where is the data from?

I took notes on how people introduced themselves during hack night intros on May 10, 2016.

See `notes` folder for data.

  + In the "raw notes", I tried to write down the exact words and phrases people used to describe themselves. I couldn't hear every person clearly, so this is (of course) messy data.

  + In the "organized notes", I tried to put attendees' introductions together into logical groups when applicable.

Note that these categories and self-descriptive terms are non-exclusive. For example, someone could be both a cofounder + web developer, grad student + data scientist, activist + designer.

But at the Hack Night, people generally introduce themselves using one short descriptor.
